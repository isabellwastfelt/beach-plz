Final Project, Beach plz

A mob programming project we made for our final project in the Technigo spring bootcamp of 2022. The project have been created by Hanna Wallber, Isabell WÃ¤stfelt and Jens Bergqvist Bromaeus.

It's a fullstack application that lists 33 public beaches in the Stockholm region that can be filtered by area. The user must create an account/log in to be able to view the beaches, leave reviews, read other users reviews and save beaches as "favorite" and see them listed on their profilepage along with all the reviews they have made.

The process

We started with making a detailed Figma-sketch to get an overview of how we wanted everything to look like in desktop, tablet and mobile, made a basic color-scheme. Listing pages and functions for each page, and what endpoints we were gonna need. Then we started with the backend to have it in place before we added the frontend functionality. After we tested it in Postman and made sure it worked as intended we started making components and pages.

During the project we worked with a Kanban board to easier keep track on tasks and for planning.

In the end of the project we went through all the code to make sure it was consistent and functional. Made a general cleanup of the code and checked the responsivity.
